# age-gender detection

The code detects age and gender of the faces in the image.
The dataset used for training : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new
The name of the images contain age and gender information
Functional model has been created with VGG16 as the base convolutional layer
Two additional FC layers and an o/p layer each for age and gender has been added to the convolutional base.
Plots between loss and accuracy for both age and gender has been plotted.
